# FB Close Button Fixer
A simple Google Chrome extension that fixes Facebook close button bug.

## Bug Sample
The texts (red boxes) are present and the close button (green circle) cannot be clicked. This is because the parent element of the texts (red boxes) is on top of the close button. So instead of closing, it will redirect you to a different page.
